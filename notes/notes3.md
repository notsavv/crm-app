## Development of the Frontend

I decided to use React as the frontend development framework. In order to install the dependencies needed, I followed these steps;

- navigated to my project's root folder and through the terminal and entered 
    - ```npx create-vite frontend --template react```
- navigated to frontend folder
    - ```cd frontend```
- installed the npm dependencies
    - ``` npm install```

By following these steps, I was able to get in touch with react's basic homepage and see the button click counter. The goal is to create a homepage for the CRM project and deal with any issues that will come up.
